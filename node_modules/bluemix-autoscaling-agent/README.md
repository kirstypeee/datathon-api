Bluemix Auto-Scaling provides dynamic scale in/out capability for all Bluemix runtimes. To support the scaling for node.js runtime, you need to inject an "Node.js Auto-Scaling Agent for Bluemix"("bluemix-autoscaling-agent") module into target applications. The new module works as Bluemix Auto-Scaling agent ("client") , and must cooperate with the Bluemix auto-scaling service ("server") to complete the scaling capabilities.  The "server" side is not an open source project, and only running on IBM Bluemix platform.

See https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/Auto-Scaling/index.html for more details.

## Getting Started
### Installation
* Install the bluemix-autoscaling-agent using npm install --save bluemix-autoscaling-agent.

* Before pushing your Node.js application, update your main file to add the agent declaration `var as_agent = require('bluemix-autoscaling-agent');` The following code snippet shows a complete entry js file with the auto-scaling agent declaration.
```code-snippet
var agent = require('bluemix-autoscaling-agent');
var http = require('http');
var server = http.createServer(function handler(req, res) {
 res.end('Hello!');
 }).listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
console.log('App is listening on port 3000');
```
